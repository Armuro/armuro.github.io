    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>Stanley Chang</p>
    <p>I do HCI research and teach UX in Taiwan.</p>
    <p>I am Yung-Ju (Stanley) Chang, an Associate Professor at the National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University in Taiwan, affiliated with the Department of Computer Science and Institute of Communication Studies. Currently, I am a visiting scholar at Stanford University, Department of Communication, contributing to the Human Screenome Project. I have a B.S. in Computer Science from National Chiao Tung University and an M.S. and Ph.D. in the School of Information from the University of Michigan. I have worked as a research intern at Microsoft Research and a Research Associate at the University of Michigan, where I was affiliated with the Michigan Interactive Social Computing group and the Interaction Ecologies Group led by Prof. Mark W. Newman. Currently, I am the director of the Mobile and Ubiquitous Interaction Lab (MUILab) at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University. My research focuses on the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Ubiquitous Computing (Ubicomp), with interests in intelligent notification systems, mobile crowdsourcing, human-AI communication, and mobile media consumption.</p>
    
    <p>Got a thing for digital well-being or curious about how we interact with our mobile phone? Let's chat. Collaboration is the spice of academic life, and I'm always eager to add more flavor!</p>
    
    <h3>For prospective students:</h3>
    <p>I welcome students keen on exploring HCI research, particularly revolving around mobile phone usage. Regardless of your academic background, your enthusiasm is what truly matters here. If you have a genuine interest and specific topics in mind, feel free to reach out! Before doing so, I recommend browsing through my recent publications to get a feel for my current focus. This will give you a better idea of the projects we might work on together in our lab.</p>
